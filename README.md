# Occupational-Safety-Using-Object-Detection
## Overview  
This project focuses on **workplace safety** by detecting whether individuals follow essential Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements such as wearing helmets, vests, and masks.  
Using **YOLOv8-based object detection**, the system acts as a real-time safety compliance and training tool for industrial environments â€” preventing accidents, promoting worker well-being, and fostering a culture of safety and productivity.

## Objectives  
- Detect PPE items such as helmets, masks, and vests in real-time.  
- Monitor and alert for missing or non-compliant safety equipment.  
- Provide visual feedback for training and awareness.  
- Demonstrate AIâ€™s application in occupational safety monitoring.  

---

## Features  
- Real-time object detection with live video feed.  
- Detection of multiple PPE classes simultaneously.  
- Color-coded bounding boxes for visual clarity:  
  - ðŸŸ© Compliant  
  - ðŸŸ¥ Violation  
  - ðŸŸ¦ Worker  
- High-speed inference using **YOLOv8**.  
- Easily extendable for different industrial environments.
